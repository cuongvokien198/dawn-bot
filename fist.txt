Documentation is a love letter to your future self.Code like there is no tomorrow.A day of debugging can save you an hour of planning.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.Code like you care.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.If code was easy, everyone would do it.Software engineering is just applied laziness.Ctrl + S is my favorite keystroke.Commit often, push regularly, and hope for the best.When in doubt, print it out.Code fast, break things.fist commit
