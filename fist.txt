Real programmers don’t comment—if it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.Push small changes frequently.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Keep your commits small and your dreams big.Commit messages should be as detailed as a tweet.There are no stupid questions, only poorly written documentation.A codebase without tests is like a city without streetlights.Documentation is a love letter to your future self.Code like there is no tomorrow.A day of debugging can save you an hour of planning.The worst part of coding is explaining it to non-coders.Code like you care.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.If code was easy, everyone would do it.Software engineering is just applied laziness.Ctrl + S is my favorite keystroke.Commit often, push regularly, and hope for the best.When in doubt, print it out.Code fast, break things.fist commit
